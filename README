Simple command line task manager

## Features:
- Simple, having around only 10 commands, with no flags or complicated
  options. Can be completely mastered in 15 minutes.
- Supports attachments, comments, tag based categorization and filtering
- Supports synchronization with git
- Small and hackable codebase (If you like Shell)
- Leverages existing tools. Lets users edit task titles, tags and
  descriptions with their own editor. Lets them handle attachments
  simply by using their own file browsers. This way prevents inflation
  of subcommands and flags; becoming more accessible to less technical
  users. Handles synchronization with peers using git, instead of
  inventing protocols or configuring task servers.
