- Use shellcheck.net to make the script compatible with
  POSIX sh.
- Add flags for interactive/non-interactive mode and screen clearing.
  Decide on the default mode (interactive/non-interactive)
- Implement a non-interactive mode. Current version is not programmable.
  Not cool.
- UX: Remember the last screen the user was in after (s)he
  runs a command such as reprioritization or tagging.
- Sorting and limiting??
- Auto-sync after some operations? Configurable?
- Ignore indexes in the repo? And reindex after each sync??
- Remove the IDs of closed tasks and make them available for
  new tasks?? (Taskwarrior style)
- Do not calculate new task ids by finding the last highest task id,
  instead make use of a counter file.
- Test with other non-linux but POSIX-compatible OSes.
- How to handle notifications?? Should we? What about let users enter
  their SMTP info and let them send mails according to others'
  notification settings??
- Document: Task tags are delimited by spaces so individual tags cannot
  contain spaces
- Document: Task names and tags can not include $SEP
- Migrate from git to hg? Think about availability and portability
- Consider trying dat instead of git for large attachments
