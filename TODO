- UX: Remember the last screen the user was in and display that after
  the user ran a command such as reprioritization or tagging.
- Auto-sync after some operations?
- Ignore indexes in the repo? And reindex after each sync??
- Remove the IDs of closed tasks
- Do not calculate new task ids by finding the last highest task id,
  but keep a counter file.
- Test with other non-linux but POSIX-compatible OSes.
- Implement a non-interactive mode. This is important as to
- enable another layer (eg a GUI) to be built on top of this.
- How to handle notifications?? Should we?
- Make sure this is compatible with bare Bourne Shell and it does
  not depend on bash. Advertise this 'feature'
- Compare this to "bug", "todoist" and "taskwarrior"
- Document: Task tags are delimited by spaces so individual tags cannot
  contain spaces
- Document: Task names and tags can not include $SEP
- Migrate from git to hg? Think about availability and portability
- Do analytics from git/hg history??
    Who did what and when
    Try to generate reports from acquired data (or enable a 3rd party)??
    Consider trying dat instead of git for large attachments
